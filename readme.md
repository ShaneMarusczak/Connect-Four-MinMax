# Connect Four

Moves for the computer player are determined using a MinMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. The pruning assumes that moves made by both the computer and the user are optimal. Branches of the decision tree that require non-optimal moves to be made are not explored.

Each difficulty controls how deep the computer searches in the decision tree.
